       " 'investment_thesis': '•  Tokio Marine (TM) is largest property & casualty (P&C) insurer in Japan by market cap. The Japanese P&C market is a 3player oligopoly market (ca 80% market share), whereas TM has the best ROE and underwriting margin, owing to its superior operating efficiency and risk selection. It is also the front runner in expanding outside of Japan (entered US in 2008). Overseas profits now contribute over half of TM’s profits – making it the most diversified Japanese financial institution.  •  TM will divest half and all of its JPY3.5trn of cross-holding shares by FY 3/2026 and FY 3/2029 respectively, similar to its peers due to a regulatory push. Moreover, a rising domestic interest rate environment and weaker Japanese Yen (over 1/3 investments are in foreign securities) would lead to larger and more significant income contribution from investments starting from this year. •  Meanwhile, due to earlier Japanese insurance regulator investigation on P&C insurers’ price collusion and a higher inflationary environment, P&C insurers should see a gradual increase in the premium rate and underwriting profitability. •  TM has a dividend payout policy of 50% adjusted profit (AP; 5year average). We expect higher shareholders’ returns, owing to larger investment gains capitalised. For FY 3/2024, total capital (dividend plus share buy-back) return is expected to be no less than 5%-7%. We initiate the stock with a Buy rating (as at 27.05.2024) and a price target of JPY 6,200 (implies 2.4x 2023 P/B). Key downside risks include unexpected large claims (ex. from natural catastrophe) and large provision for US real estate exposure. ',\n",

Founded in April 2002, the company has grown to be the largest insurance company in Japan. It operates through four segments: Domestic Non-Life, Domestic Life, International Insurance, and Financial and General. ',\n",
       " 'strengths': '•  Largest domestic P&C insurer by market cap. with superior operating metrics in terms of underwriting margins and ROE profitability •  Most advanced in terms of geographic diversification among Japanese financial firms, with overseas (low average CR at ca 90%) contributing to over half of TM’s profits •  Strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, allowing it to maintain a steady increase in dividends (increased 12-consecutive years) ',\n",
       " 'weaknesses': '•  Exposure to domestic equities and high concentration in sovereign securities •  Volatile to currency movements, given its strong overseas presence ',\n",
       " 'opportunities': '•  Expansion of its North American business (continued market hardening) through acquisitions and the launch of new business lines •  Gradual increase in premium rates, leading to higher underwriting profitability •  Accelerated divestment of all its strategically held shares to improve capital efficiency ',\n",
       " 'threats': '•  Natural catastrophes and unexpected large claims •  Adverse interest-rate movements and regulatory headwinds •  Exposure to US commercial real estate, leading to large provisions ',\n",
       " 'additional_information': 'Key operational statistics •  For the domestic P&C businesses (16% of overall AP), premiums grew at ca mid-to-low single digit. With intense competition, the CR [1] (the lower the ratio, the higher the underwriting profitability) jumped to 97.3% in 2023 from 90.6% in 2021. •  For the international business (65%), ca 70% of those premiums are generated in NA [2] through three entities: Philadelphia Insurance, Delphi Financial, and Tokio Marine HCC. The CR has been steadily maintained at ca 90% or below in the last five years, indicating much higher underwriting profitability vs domestic P&C businesses. Management guidance •  For FY 3/2024, AP guidance is expected to be JPY1.0trn (+42% y/y), largely driven by JPY300bn gains on the sale of cross-holding shares (from selling down JPY600bn equities). TM will repurchase JPY200bn of shares, with a DPS of JPY 159 (+29% y/y). •  For FY 3/2024-FY 3/2026, it expects adj. net profit EPS (excluding sale from cross share sales) CAGR of 8% or greater.

Following the completion of the MBCC integration, Julius Baer Research expects double-digit earnings growth, supported by a gradual recovery in volume growth in H2 2024.

The IndiHome and enterprise segments faced a mixed growth picture due to the reclassification of revenue, but were stable overall. EBITDA and the net income (NI) margin were a tad lower.2. Meanwhile, the rationale behind the launch of the Telkomsel Lite plan is meant to capture the underserved segment, which should not lead to cannabalisation of its own existing mobile plans, while also maintaining price competition. Since its launch, the company has seen strong traction, which we think could help to benefit the mobile segment and capture market share.3. We maintain our Buy rating (as at 25 April 2024) but lower our price target to IDR 4,000. 4. Risks: Cannibalisation of legacy mobile voice and SMS revenues from the monetisation of data, regulatory hurdles, rising competition. ',\n",

Average daily rate (ADR) increased by 36% y/y to SGD 170, exceeding pre-COVID levels, thanks to good demand from corporate groups and rising international visitor arrivals.3. Consequently, revenue per available room (RevPAR) increased 47.8% y/y to SGD 136 whereas Occupancy rose 6.3ppts y/y  to 80.1%. 4. Occupancy for FEHT may increase in FY 2024, thanks to the surge in demand for hotels due to a healthy pipeline of mega events featuring Taylor Swift and Coldplay.
