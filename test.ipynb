       " 'investment_thesis': '•  Tokio Marine (TM) is largest property & casualty (P&C) insurer in Japan by market cap. The Japanese P&C market is a 3player oligopoly market (ca 80% market share), whereas TM has the best ROE and underwriting margin, owing to its superior operating efficiency and risk selection. It is also the front runner in expanding outside of Japan (entered US in 2008). Overseas profits now contribute over half of TM’s profits – making it the most diversified Japanese financial institution.  •  TM will divest half and all of its JPY3.5trn of cross-holding shares by FY 3/2026 and FY 3/2029 respectively, similar to its peers due to a regulatory push. Moreover, a rising domestic interest rate environment and weaker Japanese Yen (over 1/3 investments are in foreign securities) would lead to larger and more significant income contribution from investments starting from this year. •  Meanwhile, due to earlier Japanese insurance regulator investigation on P&C insurers’ price collusion and a higher inflationary environment, P&C insurers should see a gradual increase in the premium rate and underwriting profitability. •  TM has a dividend payout policy of 50% adjusted profit (AP; 5year average). We expect higher shareholders’ returns, owing to larger investment gains capitalised. For FY 3/2024, total capital (dividend plus share buy-back) return is expected to be no less than 5%-7%. We initiate the stock with a Buy rating (as at 27.05.2024) and a price target of JPY 6,200 (implies 2.4x 2023 P/B). Key downside risks include unexpected large claims (ex. from natural catastrophe) and large provision for US real estate exposure. ',\n",

Founded in April 2002, the company has grown to be the largest insurance company in Japan.

With intense competition, the CR [1] (the lower the ratio, the higher the underwriting profitability) jumped to 97.3% in 2023 from 90.6% in 2021. •  For the international business (65%), ca 70% of those premiums are generated in NA [2] through three entities: Philadelphia Insurance, Delphi Financial, and Tokio Marine HCC. The CR has been steadily maintained at ca 90% or below in the last five years, indicating much higher underwriting profitability vs domestic P&C businesses. Management guidance •  For FY 3/2024, AP guidance is expected to be JPY1.0trn (+42% y/y), largely driven by JPY300bn gains on the sale of cross-holding shares (from selling down JPY600bn equities). TM will repurchase JPY200bn of shares, with a DPS of JPY 159 (+29% y/y). •  For FY 3/2024-FY 3/2026, it expects adj. net profit EPS (excluding sale from cross share sales) CAGR of 8% or greater. For FY 3/2026, TM targets ROE of 14%+ and 20%+ (including gains from cross-holding shares). ',\n",
